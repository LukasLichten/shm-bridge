                          platforms. It's particularly useful in gaming and simulations, allowing\n\

                          Example Usage:\n\n\
                          To launch the bridge and view command line options, use the following \
                          command:\n    \
                              protontricks-launch --appid APPID shm-bridge.exe\n\n\
                          This will display help output and available options for `shm-bridge`,\n\
